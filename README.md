# PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER

A password complexity checker is a tool or algorithm designed to evaluate the strength and security of passwords based on various criteria. These criteria typically include factors such as length, character diversity (e.g., uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters), and avoidance of easily guessable patterns or common words. The complexity checker assesses whether a password meets predefined requirements for strength and security, providing feedback to users to help them create more secure passwords. By analyzing passwords against established security standards, password complexity checkers play a crucial role in promoting good password hygiene and mitigating the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information and accounts.
